## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- **Recording days now stay date-ordered (F2).** `createDay` and `duplicateDay`
  previously appended to the stored `animal.days` index without sorting, so a day
  added or duplicated out of chronological order left the index unordered. The
  stored array is now canonically sorted by `date` (ascending, ISO `YYYY-MM-DD`)
  on write, so every reader sees days in chronological order. The exported YAML is
  unchanged.
- **DIO `description` types restricted to the valid digital I/O lines (`Din`/`Dout`).**
  The Type dropdown previously also offered `Accel`/`Gyro`/`Mag`, but those are
  **analog** IMU channels, not digital I/O — a DIO `description` is looked up against
  the `.rec` `ECU_digital` stream during conversion (trodes_to_nwb
  `get_digitalsignal("ECU_digital", …)`), so an analog value would fail that lookup.
  An existing analog `description` no longer crashes the editor: the Type control
  degrades gracefully to `Din` while preserving the parsed line index. The exported
  YAML shape is unchanged. Note: in the legacy single-page form, opening an imported
  event whose `description` is analog (e.g. `Accel2`) and blurring the field rewrites
  it to its `Din`/`Dout` fallback (`Din2`), because that form's control is
  uncontrolled and falls back to the first valid option when the stored one is gone.
- **New behavioral events no longer save an empty `description`.** A freshly-added
  event is now seeded to the default DIO line (`Din1`) so the stored value matches
  what the guided Type/Index controls display. Previously the controls showed
  `Din`/`1` for a new event while the model held an empty string, so saving without
  touching them persisted an empty `description` (which fails the downstream
  `ECU_digital` lookup).

### Changed

- **Restored guided DIO Type + line-index entry (F5).** The Behavioral Events /
  DIO library editor now enters a DIO event's `description` through a **Type**
  dropdown (`Din`/`Dout`) plus a numeric **DIO line index** control, instead of a
  single free-text box — recognition over recall, and it prevents a silently
  malformed DIO line name. The stored and exported `description` string is unchanged
  (e.g. `"Din1"`). When the stored `description` is a non-standard value the controls
  fall back from (an imported analog/prose string), an inline note now warns that
  editing the controls will rewrite it — making the fallback visible rather than
  silent.
- **Recording-day dates are validated as ISO `YYYY-MM-DD` on write.** `createDay`
  and `duplicateDay` now reject a non-ISO date, since the date-ordered index relies
  on `YYYY-MM-DD` sorting lexicographically as chronological (the date picker already
  enforces this; the guard covers programmatic callers).

### Added

- **Per-day behavioral-events (DIO) wiring table.** The recording-day editor now
  presents the day's behavioral events as a wiring table grouped into **Inputs
  (Din)** and **Outputs (Dout)** (plus an **Other** group for any imported
  non-standard channel), reading like the physical rig. Each row maps a hardware
  **DIO channel** (the `description`) to an **Event** (the `name`, which "becomes the
  DIO event's name in the NWB file"), edited via the guided Type/line-index controls.
  A text legend (Din = inputs, Dout = outputs), per-field hints, and an explainer
  ("edit only if you rewired the rig") accompany it; rows delete through the shared
  confirmation dialog. The animal's inherited library is still shown above as
  read-only reference. The exported YAML shape is unchanged.
- **Off-list combobox warning is now linked to its input** via `aria-describedby`
  (merged with any caller-provided value), so screen readers associate the
  standard-options nudge with the field.

- **Accessible suggestion combobox** (`SuggestionCombobox`). An editable combobox
  (WAI-ARIA "combobox with list autocomplete") that replaces the native
  `<datalist>`: opening it browses the **full** suggestion list even after a value
  is chosen (the datalist collapsed to the single match), typing filters, free
  entry is retained, and it supports keyboard navigation. An optional off-list
  nudge encourages standard values.
- **Behavioral-event name suggestions.** The event **Name** field is now this
  combobox, offering the catalog of common names (`Home box camera`, `Poke`,
  `Light`, `Pump`, `Run Camera Ticks`, `Sleep`) and warning when a non-standard
  name is entered. Free entry is retained; the stored value is unchanged.
- **Off-list warning for brain regions.** The brain-region autocomplete
  (`BrainRegionAutocomplete`, used in the Electrode Group editor) now uses the same
  combobox and warns when a region is not one of the standard options — reinforcing
  the existing CA1-vs-ca1 canonicalization that keeps Spyglass queries consistent.
