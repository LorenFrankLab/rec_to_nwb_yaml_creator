# Electron Overview

This application is an [Electron](<https://www.electronjs.org/>) application. Electron is essentially using parts of [Chrome browser's](<https://www.google.com/chrome/>) user interface and running it on [node.js](<https://nodejs.org/en/>) (a means to run Javascript code on a desktop.) In essence, a developer an write a desktop application using [Front-end tools](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front-end_web_development>). Front-end development is writing code for part of a web page a user directly interacts with. This is opposed to [back-end developer](<https://blog.hubspot.com/website/back-end-developer>) who codes for systems the front-end developer needs like calls to a database. Of course there is also full-stack developer who does both. And the lines between the front-end and back-end developer have blurred

`rec_to_nwb_yaml_creator` was built off a [Electron](<https://www.electronjs.org/>) template called [Electron React Boilerplate](<https://github.com/electron-react-boilerplate/electron-react-boilerplate>.) Documentation can be found at <https://electron-react-boilerplate.js.org/> (<https://electron-react-boilerplate.js.org/>.) Doing this removed the need to write a lot of [boilerplate code](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boilerplate_code>).
