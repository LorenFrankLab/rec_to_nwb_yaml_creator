# Scratchpad - Phase 3

**Current Phase:** Phase 3 - Code Quality & Refactoring
**Status:** ðŸŸ¢ READY TO START
**Last Updated:** 2025-10-25
**Branch:** `modern`

---

## Quick Status

**Test Suite:** 1295/1295 passing (100%) âœ…
**Coverage:** ~60% (adequate for refactoring)
**Branch Coverage:** ~45% (critical paths covered)
**Flaky Tests:** 0

**Phase 2.5 Complete:** All refactoring preparation tasks finished (10 hours, 18-29 hours saved)

---

## Phase 3 Starting Context

### What We're Refactoring

**App.js Current State:**
- ~2800 lines (too large)
- Complex state management logic
- Utility functions mixed with components
- Difficult to test and maintain

**Refactoring Goal:**
- Extract utilities to separate files (~195 lines reduction)
- Extract custom hooks for form state management
- Create reusable components
- Improve testability and maintainability

### Refactoring Safety Net

**Test Coverage:** 139 behavioral contract tests ensure safe refactoring
- updateFormData: 31 tests (all code paths)
- onBlur: 41 tests (all transformations)
- itemSelected: 16 tests (type coercion)
- nTrodeMapSelected: 21 tests (device types, shanks, ID logic)
- removeElectrodeGroupItem: 15 tests (cleanup, confirmation)
- duplicateElectrodeGroupItem: 15 tests (ID increment, duplication)

**Integration Tests:** 26 tests protect complete workflows

**Refactoring Confidence:** ðŸŸ¢ HIGH (85-95/100 safety score)

## Phase 3 Approach

**Strategy:** Extract low-risk utilities first, then medium-risk components

1. **Week 1-2:** Utility Extraction (~195 lines)
   - YAML export utilities
   - Error display utilities
   - Validation utilities
   - String formatting utilities

2. **Week 3:** Custom Hooks Extraction (if time permits)
   - Form state management hooks
   - Array management hooks

3. **Week 4+:** Component Extraction (future phase)
   - Deferred to Phase 4

---

## Current Task

**Next:** Start Phase 3 with utility extraction

**First Target:** Extract YAML Export Utilities (2 hours)
- Create `src/utils/yamlExport.js`
- Extract `convertObjectToYAMLString()` from App.js (lines 444-474)
- Run full test suite to verify no regressions
