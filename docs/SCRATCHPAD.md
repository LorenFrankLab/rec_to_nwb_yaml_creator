# Development Scratchpad

**Purpose:** Notes for ongoing development work on the rec_to_nwb_yaml_creator project.

**Status:** Phase 3 Complete - Ready for PR

---

## Phase 3 Complete - October 27, 2025

### Final Status

✅ **All exit criteria met or exceeded**

- App.js: 2794 → 485 lines (82.6% reduction)
- ESLint warnings: 0 (100% clean)
- Test coverage: 84.09%
- All 2074 tests passing
- Zero regressions

### What Was Accomplished

**Code Structure:**
- Extracted 14 React components
- Created 4 custom hooks
- Built 5 utility modules
- Implemented React Context for state management

**Quality Improvements:**
- Fixed 4 P0 critical bugs (memory leaks, error boundaries, etc.)
- Implemented 11 P1 features (keyboard accessibility, performance, modals)
- Eliminated 250 ESLint warnings
- Added 1000+ tests

**Documentation:**
- Created comprehensive completion report
- Documented all architectural decisions
- Established testing patterns
- Maintained integration contracts

### Ready for Merge

**Pre-merge verification complete:**
- ✅ All tests passing
- ✅ ESLint clean (0 warnings)
- ✅ Build succeeds
- ✅ Golden YAML tests passing
- ✅ Performance baselines passing
- ✅ Integration contracts verified
- ✅ Documentation cleaned up

**Next steps:**
1. Create PR: `modern` → `main`
2. Use "Squash and merge" strategy
3. Deploy to GitHub Pages after merge
4. Tag release as v3.0.0

## Notes for Future Development

### Key Architectural Decisions

1. **State Management:** React Context pattern chosen over Redux/Zustand for simplicity
2. **Validation:** Three-tier system (instant hints, field errors, form errors)
3. **Testing:** TDD approach with deep merge pattern for component tests
4. **YAML Output:** Deterministic with sorted keys for reproducibility

### Integration Points

**trodes_to_nwb (Python):**
- Schema must stay synchronized (nwb_schema.json)
- Device types must match probe_metadata/ files
- YAML filename pattern: `{YYYYMMDD}_{subject_id}_metadata.yml`

**Spyglass (Database):**
- Probe types must be pre-registered
- Brain region naming must be consistent
- ndx_franklab_novela extension columns required

### Development Workflow

**Before making changes:**
1. Run `/setup` to verify environment
2. Create feature branch from `main`
3. Write tests first (TDD)
4. Make minimal changes
5. Verify all tests pass
6. Run ESLint
7. Check golden YAML tests

**Testing commands:**
```bash
npm test                    # Run tests in watch mode
npm test -- --run           # Run tests once
npm test -- --coverage      # Generate coverage report
npm run lint                # Run ESLint
npm run build               # Build production bundle
```

### Common Gotchas

1. **Controlled inputs:** All form inputs must be controlled (no mixed mode)
2. **Array keys:** Use stable IDs from schema, not array indices
3. **YAML determinism:** Always use `encodeYaml()` from `io/yaml.js`
4. **Test fixtures:** Use deep merge for partial state initialization
5. **Memory leaks:** Always revoke blob URLs after download

## Known Issues

**None.** All critical and high-priority issues have been resolved.

## Future Enhancements (P2 Priority)

If continuing development, consider:

1. **TypeScript migration** (8-10 hours)
   - Gradual conversion starting with utilities
   - Type definitions for form data

2. **Improved error messages** (2-3 hours)
   - WHAT/WHY/HOW framework
   - Recovery steps for users

3. **Loading states** (1-2 hours)
   - Skeleton screens during import
   - Progress indicators

**Phase:** 3 (Complete)
**Status:** Ready for main branch merge
