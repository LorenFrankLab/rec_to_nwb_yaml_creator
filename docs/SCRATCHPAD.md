## Previous Session: M5.5.4 - Calendar-Based Day Creation + Critical Fixes

**Status:** ✅ PRODUCTION-READY - All critical issues fixed, tests passing

### Session Timeline

**Phase 1: Initial Implementation** (Previous session)

- Created 7 calendar components with full styling and tests
- Integrated with AnimalWorkspace
- Conducted UX, UI, and code reviews

**Phase 2: Critical Fixes** (Current session - October 28, 2025)

1. ✅ Fixed JSDoc syntax errors (13 locations: `{function}` → `{Function}`)
2. ✅ Added PropTypes to all 5 components
3. ✅ Fixed timezone bug in today indicator (UTC → local time)
4. ✅ Fixed DST bug in `getDateRange()` (calendar arithmetic instead of `setDate()`)
5. ✅ Fixed multi-select behavior (removed Ctrl/Cmd requirement - click now toggles)
6. ✅ Fixed click not working (removed drag handlers that were calling `preventDefault()`)
7. ✅ Fixed date parsing in aria-labels (UTC → local time parsing)
8. ✅ Updated 19 tests to use reliable aria-label selectors
9. ✅ Simplified architecture (removed drag state and handlers)

### Components (Updated)

- CalendarDayCreator.jsx (178 lines) - Container with toggle selection
- CalendarGrid.jsx (114 lines) - Simple grid rendering
- CalendarDay.jsx (88 lines) - Click-to-toggle cells
- CalendarHeader.jsx (71 lines) - Month navigation
- CalendarLegend.jsx (35 lines) - Visual legend
- CalendarDayCreator.css (316 lines) - Complete styling
- CalendarDayCreator.test.jsx (377 lines, 19 tests)

### User Interaction Model

- **Plain Click:** Toggle individual date (add/remove from selection)
- **Shift+Click:** Select range from first selected to clicked date
- **Click Existing Day:** Disabled (cannot select days that already exist)
- **Clear Button:** Remove all selections
- **Create Button:** Batch-create all selected days

### Test Results (Final)

- Total: 2394 passing, 4 failing (unrelated to calendar)
- Calendar: 19/19 passing ✅ (added 2 new tests for multi-select and deselect)
- AnimalWorkspace: 10/10 passing ✅

### Resolved Critical Issues

#### Fixed - JSDoc Errors

- Changed all 13 occurrences from `{function}` to `{Function}`
- Linter now clean (0 errors)

#### Fixed - PropTypes Missing

- Added PropTypes to CalendarDayCreator, CalendarGrid, CalendarDay, CalendarHeader
- Proper validation for all props including shapes and instanceOf(Set)

#### Fixed - Timezone Bugs

- Today indicator now uses local time instead of UTC (`new Date()` components instead of `toISOString()`)
- Date range generation uses calendar arithmetic instead of `setDate()` to avoid DST issues
- Aria-label date parsing uses local time to avoid off-by-one day errors

#### Fixed - Click Not Working

- Root cause: Drag handlers called `event.preventDefault()` which blocked click events
- Solution: Removed all drag functionality (onMouseDown, onMouseEnter, onMouseUp)
- Simplified to click-only interaction (cleaner UX, fewer bugs)

#### Fixed - Multi-Select Behavior

- Changed default click behavior from "replace selection" to "toggle"
- Users can now click multiple non-consecutive dates without holding Ctrl/Cmd
- Shift+Click still works for range selection

### Priority Actions

**MUST FIX (Before Commit):**
1. Fix JSDoc: `{function}` → `{Function}` (30 min)
2. Add PropTypes to all 5 components (1 hour)
3. Fix timezone bug in today calculation (2 hours)
4. Fix DST bug in getDateRange() (2 hours)

**SHOULD FIX (Before Production):**
5. Fix color contrast (#4caf50 → #388e3c) (30 min)
6. Add ARIA live region (1 hour)
7. Implement arrow key navigation (3 hours)
8. Add >30 day confirmation (30 min)
9. Better batch error reporting (2 hours)

**CONSIDER (Future):**
10. Align CSS variables with design system (4 hours)
11. Extract shared button components (2 hours)
12. Add reduced motion support (1 hour)

**Estimated effort to production-ready:** 10-14 hours

## Previous Session: M5.5 Post-Release Fixes + Date Picker

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE (replaced by calendar in M5.5.4)

**User Feedback:**

1. Sex field should not have "Other (O)" option - only Male (M), Female (F), Unknown (U)
2. Navigation after animal creation goes to wrong page (workspace loads legacy form instead of AnimalWorkspace)
3. Error when trying to add more than one recording day: "Day 'bean-2025-10-28' already exists"

**Fixes Applied:**

1. ✅ Removed "Other (O)" option from Sex radio buttons in AnimalCreationForm.jsx
2. ✅ Added URL parameter handling to AnimalWorkspace - reads `?animal=<id>` to auto-select animal
3. ✅ **Fixed parseHashRoute to strip query parameters before route matching**
   - Issue: `#/workspace?animal=bean` was treated as unknown route → fell back to legacy form
   - Fix: Strip query parameters before matching routes in useHashRouter.js
   - Added 4 new tests for query parameter handling
4. ✅ **Added date picker for recording day creation**
   - Issue: "Add Recording Day" button always used today's date, causing duplicates
   - Fix: Added HTML5 date input next to button allowing users to select any date
   - Added client-side duplicate detection with helpful error message
   - Date input defaults to today, resets after successful creation
   - Added 3 new tests for date picker functionality
5. ✅ All 2379 tests passing (2376 previous + 3 new date picker tests)

**Root Cause:**

The navigation was going to the correct URL (`#/workspace?animal=bean`), but the hash router was rejecting it because it didn't match the exact string `"/workspace"`. The router needed to strip query parameters before matching.

**Note on Experimenter Names:**

- Current implementation is correct - experimenter_name is an array of strings (full names)
- Examples in schema: "Jennifer Guidera", "Alison Comrie"
- Names like "Kyu Hyun Lee" work correctly as-is (stored as single string in array)

## M5 Design Phase Summary

**Date:** 2025-10-28

**Brainstorming Completed:**
- Phase 1: Understanding ✅ (field editability, navigation style, validation timing, store integration)
- Phase 2: Exploration ✅ (chose Approach B: Stepper Container + Separate Step Components)
- Phase 3: Design Presentation ✅ (component structure, stepper design, OverviewStep, StepNavigation, validation, accessibility)

**Design Decisions Made:**
1. **Field Editability:** Inherited fields (subject, experimenters) read-only with "Edit Animal" link
2. **Navigation Style:** Hybrid validation-gated (all steps clickable, export disabled until valid)
3. **Validation Timing:** On blur (matches existing codebase)
4. **Store Integration:** Auto-save on blur with visual feedback
5. **Architecture:** Container/Presentational pattern (DayEditorStepper → OverviewStep)

**Files to Create:**
```
src/pages/DayEditor/
  ├─ DayEditorStepper.jsx          (~200-250 lines)
  ├─ OverviewStep.jsx               (~150-200 lines)
  ├─ StepNavigation.jsx             (~80-100 lines)
  ├─ SaveIndicator.jsx              (~40-60 lines)
  ├─ ReadOnlyField.jsx              (~30-40 lines)
  ├─ validation.js                  (~100-150 lines)
  ├─ DayEditor.css                  (~150-200 lines)
  └─ __tests__/
      ├─ DayEditorStepper.test.jsx  (~80 lines, 8 tests)
      ├─ OverviewStep.test.jsx      (~120 lines, 12 tests)
      └─ StepNavigation.test.jsx    (~60 lines, 6 tests)
```

**Critical Issues Identified (P0 - Must Fix Before Implementation):**

1. **Store Integration Mismatch** - `updateDay()` replaces entire nested objects, need field-level update wrapper
2. **Validation State Management Unclear** - Must use `day.state.validationErrors` in store for persistence
3. **Animal/Day Data Merging Not Implemented** - Need `mergeDayMetadata()` utility for validation
4. **Missing DayId Resolution** - Need `useDayIdFromUrl()` hook to parse URL params
5. **Auto-Save Conflict Resolution Missing** - Need visibility change detection for multi-tab editing
6. **No Recovery Path for localStorage Full** - Need graceful degradation with quota handling
7. **Screen Reader Step Status Not Redundantly Encoded** - Need text alternatives for icons
8. **Color Palette Mismatch** - Must use existing system (#2196f3 not #0066cc)
9. **Missing CSS Class Definitions** - Need complete DayEditor.css before implementation
10. **Typography System Not Defined** - Must standardize on existing font hierarchy

**Action Items Before Implementation:**
- [ ] Implement `handleFieldUpdate()` with proper nested object updates
- [ ] Define validation state caching strategy (store-backed)
- [ ] Create `mergeDayMetadata()` utility in workspaceUtils.js
- [ ] Implement `useDayIdFromUrl()` hook
- [ ] Add error handling with try-catch for all store operations
- [ ] Implement auto-save conflict detection
- [ ] Add localStorage quota error handling
- [ ] Fix screen reader step status announcements
- [ ] Create complete DayEditor.css with all component styles
- [ ] Update color palette to match existing system
- [ ] Define typography hierarchy
- [ ] Choose icon implementation strategy (SVG recommended)

**Estimated Effort:**
- P0 fixes: 4-6 hours design revision
- Implementation: 2-3 days after revisions approved
- Total: ~3-4 days for complete M5

**Next Steps:**
1. Review M5_DESIGN_REVIEW.md and discuss P0 issues
2. Address all P0 critical issues
3. Create revised design document
4. Set up worktree for implementation
5. Write tests first (TDD)
6. Implement components
7. Run code review
8. Verify and document completion

### Open Questions

1. **Import existing YAMLs**: Batch import from directory (defer to Phase 2)
2. **Experiment description**: Animal-level with day override (recommended)
3. **Weight tracking**: Animal default with day override (recommended)
4. **Camera IDs**: Animal-level with day override (recommended)
