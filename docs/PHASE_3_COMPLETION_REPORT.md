## Lessons Learned

### What Went Well

1. **TDD Approach**
   - Writing tests first prevented regressions
   - Caught integration issues early
   - Improved code design

2. **Incremental Refactoring**
   - Small, focused PRs easier to review
   - Reduced risk of breaking changes
   - Maintained working state throughout

3. **Parallel Agent Work**
   - Significantly reduced time (45% faster on components)
   - Maintained quality with code reviews
   - Efficient use of AI capabilities

4. **Golden YAML Tests**
   - Caught YAML output regressions immediately
   - Provided confidence in refactoring
   - Determinism guaranteed

5. **Code Reviews**
   - Caught critical bugs before merge (StoreContext memoization)
   - Improved code quality
   - Shared knowledge

### Challenges & Solutions

1. **Store Pattern Needs Context**
   - **Challenge:** Multiple useStore() calls created separate state instances
   - **Solution:** Implemented StoreContext provider pattern
   - **Learning:** Always use Context for shared state hooks

2. **Controlled vs Uncontrolled Inputs**
   - **Challenge:** Mixed controlled/uncontrolled state caused bugs
   - **Solution:** Migrated all inputs to controlled mode
   - **Learning:** Consistency matters more than flexibility

3. **Test Coverage vs Quality**
   - **Challenge:** High coverage but some tests were trivial
   - **Solution:** Focused on meaningful tests, deleted documentation tests
   - **Learning:** Coverage percentage isn't everything

4. **ESLint Warnings in Tests**
   - **Challenge:** Test infrastructure creates unused variables
   - **Solution:** Accepted test file warnings as acceptable tradeoff
   - **Learning:** Production code quality > test code perfectionism

### Recommendations for Future

1. **Maintain incremental approach**
   - Continue small, focused changes
   - Keep PRs under 500 lines
   - Review after each major change

2. **Keep golden tests updated**
   - Run golden tests before every commit
   - Update fixtures when schema changes
   - Document any YAML format changes

3. **Leverage parallel agents**
   - Use for independent cleanup tasks
   - Always code review agent output
   - Batch similar tasks for efficiency

4. **Document decisions**
   - Update SCRATCHPAD.md with session notes
   - Capture blockers and solutions
   - Track time estimates vs actuals
