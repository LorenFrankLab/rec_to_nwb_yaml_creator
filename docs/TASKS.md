**Acceptance (DoD)**

* ✅ Users can create animals from Home page (#/home)
* ✅ Form validates all required fields with inline errors
* ✅ Submit disabled until all fields valid
* ✅ Unique subject_id enforced (checks existing animals)
* ✅ Date of birth cannot be in future
* ✅ At least one experimenter required
* ✅ Smart defaults populate from settings/last animal
* ✅ Species uses constrained dropdown (prevents DB pollution)
* ✅ After creation, navigates to AnimalWorkspace with animal selected
* ✅ First-time users see welcome message with documentation link
* ✅ All 27 tests passing (2370 total: 2343 existing + 27 new)
* ✅ WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliant
* ✅ Keyboard navigation works (Tab, Enter, Escape, Ctrl+Enter)
* ✅ Screen readers announce errors correctly
* ✅ Code review approved (all P0 issues fixed)

**Rationale**

**Critical Gap:** M4 (AnimalWorkspace) and M5 (Day Editor) assume animals already exist, but there's no UI to create them. Users are stuck using legacy form or browser console. This milestone fills that gap before M6.

**Design Philosophy:** Progressive disclosure - collect only what's known at "animal creation time" (subject info + experimenters), defer hardware configuration to Day Editor per session. Matches scientific workflow and reduces cognitive load.

**Artifacts**

* ✅ `docs/M5.5_DESIGN.md` (design document with review feedback, 1432 lines)
* ✅ `src/pages/Home/index.jsx` (updated - container component, 146 lines)
* ✅ `src/pages/Home/AnimalCreationForm.jsx` (new - form component, 560 lines)
* ✅ `src/pages/Home/Home.css` (new - styling, 234 lines)
* ✅ `src/pages/Home/__tests__/Home.test.jsx` (new - 8 tests, 198 lines)
* ✅ `src/pages/Home/__tests__/AnimalCreationForm.test.jsx` (new - 19 tests, 388 lines)
* ✅ `src/pages/DayEditor/DayEditor.css` (updated - added 4 CSS variables)

**Form Fields (8 total):**

1. Subject ID (text, unique, required)
2. Species (dropdown: Rat/Mouse/Marmoset/Macaque/Other, required)
3. Sex (radio: M/F/U/O, required)
4. Genotype (text, required)
5. Date of Birth (date picker, no future dates, required)
6. Experimenter Names (dynamic list, min 1, required)
7. Lab (text, pre-filled, required)
8. Institution (text, pre-filled, required)

**Test Results:** 2370 tests passed, 1 skipped (27 new tests added)

**Design Reviews:**

* Code Review: REQUEST_CHANGES → APPROVED (P0-1: JSDoc fixed, P0-2: CSS variables added)
* UI Review: NEEDS_POLISH → APPROVED (Material Design consistency, responsive)
* UX Review: NEEDS_POLISH → APPROVED (progressive disclosure, smart defaults)

**Actual Effort:** 12 hours (completed 2025-10-28)

### **M7 – Animal Editor (Electrode Groups & Device Configuration)** ✅

**Status:** COMPLETE (2025-10-29)

**Rationale**

Animal-level electrode group configuration is currently only accessible via the legacy form. This milestone brings electrode group editing into the modern UI, allowing users to configure device types, channel maps, and stereotaxic coordinates without leaving the new workflow.

**Critical Design Constraint:** This is **animal-level** configuration that applies to all days unless overridden. Changes here affect the baseline configuration inherited by all recording sessions.

**Tasks**

* [x] Create `AnimalEditor` page component with stepper navigation ✅
* [x] Implement `ElectrodeGroupsStep` with CRUD operations (add/edit/delete groups) ✅
* [x] Add device type selection dropdown (integrates with `deviceTypes.js`) ✅
* [x] Implement auto-generation of ntrode channel maps when device type selected ✅
* [x] Add `ChannelMapEditor` component for editing ntrode mappings ✅
  * [x] Grid UI showing logical channel → hardware channel mappings ✅
  * [x] CSV import/export for bulk editing ✅
  * [x] Validation for duplicate/missing channels ✅
* [x] Add stereotaxic coordinate inputs (AP, ML, DV) for each electrode group ✅
* [x] Implement brain region (location) field with autocomplete for consistency ✅
* [x] Add reference electrode configuration ✅
* [x] Create `useAnimalIdFromUrl` hook for routing ✅ (simplified - no dedicated editor hook needed)
* [x] Integrate validation framework (schema + rules validation) ✅
* [x] Add navigation from AnimalWorkspace sidebar to Animal Editor ✅
* [x] Update DevicesStep to link to new Animal Editor (replace legacy links) ✅
* [x] Write comprehensive test suite (target: 50+, actual: 114 tests) ✅
  * [x] CRUD operations for electrode groups ✅
  * [x] Device type selection and channel map generation ✅
  * [x] Channel map validation (duplicates, missing, sequential) ✅
  * [x] CSV import/export round-trip ✅
  * [x] Inherited data propagation to days ✅
* [x] Add accessibility tests (WCAG 2.1 Level AA) ✅
* [x] Request code review before completion ✅ (APPROVED with P1 fixes applied)
* [x] Update documentation (TASKS.md, SCRATCHPAD.md, CHANGELOG.md) ✅

**Acceptance (DoD)**

* ✅ Users can create/edit/delete electrode groups in new UI
* ✅ Device type selection auto-generates appropriate channel maps
* ✅ Channel maps editable via grid UI and CSV import/export
* ✅ All validation rules enforced (duplicates, gaps, required fields)
* ✅ Changes propagate to all days as inherited baseline
* ✅ Days can still override bad_channels at day-level (M6 DevicesStep)
* ✅ No regressions in existing tests (2681 passing, 1 skipped)
* ✅ All new tests passing (114 tests across 6 files)
* ✅ WCAG 2.1 Level AA compliant
* ✅ Code review approved (P1 issues fixed)

**Artifacts**

* ✅ `src/pages/AnimalEditor/index.jsx` - Main container (30 lines)
* ✅ `src/pages/AnimalEditor/AnimalEditorStepper.jsx` - Stepper navigation (475 lines)
* ✅ `src/pages/AnimalEditor/ElectrodeGroupsStep.jsx` - CRUD table interface (285 lines)
* ✅ `src/pages/AnimalEditor/ElectrodeGroupModal.jsx` - Add/edit form modal (530 lines)
* ✅ `src/pages/AnimalEditor/CopyFromAnimalDialog.jsx` - Template/copy dialog (185 lines)
* ✅ `src/pages/AnimalEditor/ChannelMapsStep.jsx` - Channel maps step (220 lines)
* ✅ `src/pages/AnimalEditor/ChannelMapEditor.jsx` - Grid UI editor (440 lines)
* ✅ `src/hooks/useAnimalIdFromUrl.js` - URL parsing hook (48 lines)
* ✅ `src/pages/AnimalEditor/__tests__/` - Test suite (114 tests across 6 files)
* ✅ Material Design CSS integrated into existing DayEditor.css
* ✅ CSV import/export utilities (csvChannelMapUtils.js)
* ✅ Channel map generation utilities (channelMapUtils.js)

**Integration Points:**

* **AnimalWorkspace:** Add "Edit Electrode Groups" button/link
* **DevicesStep:** Replace `#/legacy` links with `#/animal/:id/editor`
* **Store:** Animal electrode group changes update `animals` state
* **Validation:** Reuse existing schema + rules validation from M6

**Actual Effort:** ~32 hours (completed over multiple sessions)

**Test Results:** 2681 tests passing, 1 skipped (114 new M7 tests)

**Code Review:** APPROVED (all P1 issues fixed in commit c75290d)
